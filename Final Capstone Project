Introduction / Business Problem:

During this capstone project, I will use geographic data of Los Angeles from Foursquare 
to make a restaurant recommendation for a new starter who wants to open it in Los Angeles.

As we know that it's hard to successfully run a business if we don't know the economic situation 
and geographic information, because we might open the store in a wrong place that we cannot attract 
target customers. Thus I will use location data to explore a geographical location, segment and 
cluster neighborhoods, trying to find the most situable place to open new restaurant.
